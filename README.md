# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide is a short project that help us understand a little bit about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. It is really interesting to see it because even though it is simple, you can learn a lot from it. It helps you to study the different topics. I learned how to create a website using different computing languages like HTML and CSS plus giving it a little bit of Git and JavaScript.
